# Hi, I'm Danny. Welcome to my workspace.

## âš¡ About Me

I am an App Academy graduate and CO native with a background in Mathematics. Conditioned by an enthusiasm to learn, willingness to struggle, and patience in the problem-solving process, I view programming as an intuitive way to express my mathematical strengths.

As a software engineer, I love the idea of bringing my own ideas into fruition, and bridging the gap between foreign conceptualization and a tangible, impactful end product. I am eager to apply my experience in building dynamic web applications in JavaScript, Python, and HTML/CSS.

When I'm not programming, I enjoy powerlifting, trying new teas, and participating in fantasy football with friends.
